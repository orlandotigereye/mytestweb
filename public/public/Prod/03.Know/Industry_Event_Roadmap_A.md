# Industry Event Roadmap | 產業活動路線圖

How to network at major VTuber and Live2D events to find high-value partners.
如何在大規模 VTuber 與 Live2D 活動中建立人脈並尋找高價值合作夥伴。

## 📅 1. Key Industry Events | 核心產業活動
Mark these on your calendar. (請在行事曆標記這些重要時程)

- **Anime Expo (AX) / Vibe (USA)**: Major physical gatherings for VTuber fans and riggers. (大型實體聚會)
- **Virtual Market (VRChat)**: The largest global virtual event. Great for seeing new model tech. (全球最大虛擬展示會)
- **Live2D Creative Awards**: An annual online competition. The best time to reach top-tier riggers. (年度技術競賽，開發高階綁定師的最佳時機)
- **TwitchCon**: Essential for meeting mid-to-large scale streamers who need content tools. (接洽中大型實況主的關鍵場合)

## 🎯 2. The "Event Hack" Strategy | 活動開發戰術
Don't just go as a fan. Go as a **Solution Provider**.
不要只以粉絲身分參加，要以「解決方案提供者」的身分出席。

### **The Virtual Strategy (虛擬活動)**:
- **Action**: Monitor event hashtags (e.g., `#Vket`, `#Live2DAwards`).
- **Action**: When an artist posts their event entry, use the **Personalized Video Pitch** to show them an automated version of their entry.
- **重點**：利用活動標籤，針對參賽作品進行「自動化演示」開發。

### **The Physical Strategy (實體活動)**:
- **Action**: Have a 15-second demo ready on your phone/tablet.
- **Action**: Visit Artist Alley. Complement their rigging, then ask: "Have you ever tried automating your showcases?"
- **重點**：隨身攜帶演示影片，在創作者攤位進行精準開發。

---

## 🤝 3. The "After-Party" Networking | 賽後人脈經營
- Most big deals happen in DMs *after* an event.
- **Action**: Collect handles of the "Rising Stars" at the event. 
- **Action**: Reach out 2 days after the event ends: "Saw your showcase at [Event]! It was incredible. I've built a tool that could make recording your next one even easier..."

---

## 🚀 Why this works | 為什麼這有效
Events create a **Concentration of Intent**. Everyone there is looking for growth, recognition, and better tools. By appearing at the right time, your tool feels like a "Gift" rather than a "Sales Pitch."

---

## 🚀 Pro Tip | 專家建議
Prepare a special **"Event Discount Code"** (e.g., "AX2026") to give to people you meet in person. This creates a sense of exclusivity and helps you track which events bring the best ROI.
