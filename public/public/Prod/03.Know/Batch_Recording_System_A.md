## 🏗️ 1. The Concept | 核心概念
Instead of running a script manually for every single video, the **Batch System** uses an array of Sheet IDs and loops through them, spawning a fresh browser instance for each recording.
與其手動為每支影片執行腳本，**批量系統**使用一個包含多個 ID 的陣列進行迴圈處理，為每次錄製啟動全新的瀏覽器實例。

## 🛠️ 2. How to Use | 操作方式
1. Open `public/note_js/record_batch_Pro_A.js` in your text editor.
2. Find the `sheetList` array at the bottom of the file.
3. Paste all the Google Sheet IDs you want to record.
4. Run the command:
   `node public/note_js/record_batch_Pro_A.js`

## ⚡ 3. Automation Benefits | 自動化優點
- **Hands-Free Sunday**: Spend 1 hour writing 10 scripts in Google Sheets, then run the batch script and go enjoy your weekend.
- **Scalability**: You can record 50+ videos overnight without touching your mouse once.
- **重點**：這能讓您的「批量製作」產能提升 10 倍以上。

## 🚀 4. Why this increases LTV | 為什麼這能提升 LTV
By offering "Batch Recording" as part of your **Agency White-Label Suite**, you solve a massive logistical problem for managers who have 20+ talents to handle.
當您為經紀公司提供「批量代錄」服務時，您解決了他們管理數十位成員時最大的流程痛點。

## 🚀 Pro Tip | 專家建議
Ensure your PC has enough disk space! Batch recordings can easily consume 5GB+ of storage if you record many 4K videos in a row. Always run the **Technical Sanity Check** before starting a long batch.
