## 🛍️ 1. The Big Four Platforms | 四大核心平台

### **A. Gumroad (The Global Hub)**
- **Best for**: International users and automated Email marketing.
- **Action**: Use it as your primary backend for **Affiliate Tracking** and **Nurture Sequences**.
- **重點**：作為全球中心，處理主要的分潤追蹤與郵件行銷。

### **B. Booth.pm (The Creator Standard)**
- **Best for**: Japanese and high-end rigging communities.
- **Action**: Focus on "Aesthetic" presentation. Use the **Japanese Market Strategy**.
- **重點**：針對日本與高端綁定社群，強調美學呈現。

### **C. Ko-fi (The Community Favorite)**
- **Best for**: Building a "Supporter" base and taking small custom tips.
- **Action**: Use the "Shop" feature for Mini-Packs ($9) and the "Commissions" feature for the **Custom Showcase Service**.
- **重點**：利用其「商店」功能販售微型包，並用「委託」功能處理客製化服務。

### **D. Itch.io (The Indie Tech Hub)**
- **Best for**: Reaching developers and experimental creators.
- **Action**: List the tool under the "Assets" or "Tools" category. Great for SEO as Itch has high domain authority.
- **重點**：鎖定開發者與實驗性創作者，利用其高權威網域提升 SEO。

## 📈 2. Cross-Platform Pricing Consistency | 跨平台定價一致性
- **Rule**: Keep the base price ($29) the same across all stores. (保持定價一致)
- **Strategy**: Use platform-specific bundles. 
  - *Example*: Offer a "Ko-fi Exclusive" background if they buy through your Ko-fi link to reward your loyal community.

## 🔗 3. Centralizing Traffic | 流量歸口策略
- **Action**: Every marketplace listing MUST link back to your **Bento.me** page or **Authority Website**.
- **Why**: If a user finds you on Itch.io, you want them to eventually see your **Rigging Checklist** and other products to increase their **LTV**.
- **重點**：所有商店頁面都必須導流回您的核心門戶（Bento.me 或官網）。

## 🚀 Pro Tip | 專家建議
Update all marketplace descriptions simultaneously when you release a new version (e.g., v1.2). Consistent updates across all stores prove that the tool is well-maintained and professional.
