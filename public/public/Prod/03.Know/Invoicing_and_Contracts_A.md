## 🧾 1. Professional Invoicing | 發票開立
- **Tool**: Use **PayPal Invoicing**, **Stripe**, or **Wise**.
- **Requirement**: Always include a unique **Invoice Number**, **Date**, and a clear **Description of Service**.
- **重點**：即便是在網路上的客製化接案，正式的發票能建立極高的專業信任感。

## 📜 2. Simple Service Agreement (Contract) | 服務協議模板
Include these 3 critical clauses in every custom project email or PDF.
在每次客製化專案的 Email 或 PDF 中包含這三項關鍵條款。

### **A. Scope of Work (服務範圍)**
"I will deliver 1 automated recording script and 3 custom backgrounds for the character [Model Name]. Any additional requests outside of this list will require a new quote."
(明確定義服務內容，防止客戶無止盡地追加要求)

### **B. Payment Terms (支付條款)**
"50% non-refundable deposit is required to start. The remaining 50% must be paid upon delivery of the low-res preview video."
(規定先付 50% 訂金，看到預覽後付清尾款，再交出高畫質原檔)

### **C. Delivery & Revision (交付與修改)**
"Delivery will be within 5 business days. The project includes 1 round of minor revisions (e.g., color tweaks, text changes)."
(規定交期與修改次數)

## 🛡️ 3. Why a Contract matters | 為什麼合約很重要
- It prevents "Scope Creep" (clients asking for more than they paid for).
- It ensures you get paid for your time even if the client cancels mid-way.
- It makes you look like a **Business**, not a hobbyist.

## 🚀 Pro Tip | 專家建議
Use a tool like **HelloSign** or **DocuSign** for high-end agency contracts ($500+). For smaller custom setups ($149), a clear "Agreement Email" where the client replies "I accept" is legally sufficient in most cases.
