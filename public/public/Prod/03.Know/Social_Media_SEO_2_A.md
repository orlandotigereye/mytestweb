## 🚀 1. The "On-Screen" SEO | 螢幕文字 SEO
Algorithms now "read" the text inside your videos.
演算法現在會「讀取」影片內顯示的文字。
- **Action**: Always include the words **"Live2D"**, **"VTuber"**, and **"Automation"** as large on-screen text in the first 3 seconds.
- **Why**: This helps the AI categorize your video faster and show it to the right people.
- **重點**：在前 3 秒將核心關鍵字以大字顯示在螢幕上，幫助 AI 精準分類。

## 🚀 2. The "Comment Trigger" Strategy | 「留言觸發」策略
Comments are the strongest signal for the algorithm. Stop asking for general comments.
留言是演算法最強的訊號。停止尋求一般性的留言。
- **Action**: Ask people to comment a **specific word** to get a resource.
- **Formula**: "Comment **'LINK'** and I'll DM you the free template!"
- **Why**: 100 people typing the same word tells the algorithm your post is "Viral," causing it to explode in reach.
- **重點**：要求使用者回覆「關鍵字」來獲取資源，營造「爆文」訊號。

## 🚀 3. Cross-Platform Linking Patterns | 跨平台連結模式
Never post a direct Gumroad link in your IG caption (it kills reach).
絕對不要在 IG 說明欄直接放 Gumroad 連結（這會扼殺觸及率）。
- **The Pattern**: Post the Reel -> Direct to **Link in Bio** -> Link in Bio goes to **Bento.me** -> Bento.me links to **Gumroad**.
- **Why**: Platforms hate it when you try to take users away. Bento.me acts as a "Buffer" that protects your reach.
- **重點**：使用 Bento.me 作為緩衝，避免直接外連導致的降權。

## 🚀 4. The "Watch-Time" Loop | 完看率循環
- **Action**: Make your captions slightly longer than the video.
- **Why**: While users are reading the caption, the video loops in the background. This tricks the algorithm into thinking people are watching your video multiple times.
- **重點**：說明文字長度略長於影片，讓使用者在閱讀時影片自動重複播放，提升「完看率」。

## 🚀 Pro Tip | 專家建議
For X (Twitter), the algorithm rewards **Long-form Replies**. Instead of saying "Thanks!", write a 2-sentence expert tip in your replies to people. This increases your "Authoritativeness" score.
