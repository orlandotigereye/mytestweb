## 📈 4. Success Metrics | 成功指標
- **Cost Per Click (CPC)**: Aim for under $0.50.
- **Return on Investment (ROI)**: If $5/day gets you 5 free downloads, and 1 out of 50 free users buys the $29 Pro bundle, the ads pay for themselves!

Run the ad for at least **4 days** before changing anything. The algorithm needs time to find the right people. If the CPC is too high, change the "Hook" in your video text.
