Strategic protocols for high-stakes brand protection and crisis control.
高風險品牌保護與危機控管的戰略協議。

---

## 🛡️ 1. Scenario: The "Cancel Culture" Attack | 應對網路出征
**Risk**: A competitor or critic starts a viral trend claiming your automation "steals art" or uses "hidden AI."
**風險**：競爭對手或批評者散播謠言，稱您的自動化工具是在「偷竊藝術」或使用了「隱藏 AI」。

- **The "Data Fact-Sheet" Response**: Do not engage in an emotional argument. Post a technical infographic showing exactly how Puppeteer interacts with the model file.
- **The "Artist Testimonial" Defense**: Tag 3 high-authority riggers who use your tool. Let their reputation act as your shield.
- **重點**：用「技術事實」與「專家見證」來回應感性攻擊。

---

## 🛡️ 2. Scenario: Data Security Concerns | 應對數據安全疑慮
**Risk**: A user claims that your tool "stole their model files" or acts as "spyware."
**風險**：使用者聲稱您的工具「竊取了其模型檔案」或充當「間諜軟體」。

- **The "Local-First" Audit**: Publish a standard report confirming the tool runs 100% locally.
- **The "Open Source Audit" Offer**: "If you represent a security firm, we are happy to share our core source code for a private safety audit."
- **重點**：強調本地執行屬性，並展現開放第三方審查的自信。

---

## 🛡️ 3. Scenario: Public Disagreement with a Partner | 處理夥伴分歧
**Risk**: An influencer partner posts negative things about you or your tool after a disagreement.
**風險**：合作夥伴在發生分歧後公開發表負面言論。

- **The "High-Road" Logic**: Never attack the influencer back.
- **Public Response**: "[Partner Name] is an incredible artist, and we respect their work. We’re sorry to hear they had a negative experience. We’ve reached out privately to resolve this and learn how to improve our tool for everyone."
- **重點**：始終維持風度，將問題引導至「私下解決」與「產品改進」。

---

## 🛡️ 4. The "Dark Period" Protocol | 「靜默期」協議
In a major crisis (e.g., a massive server bug or legal threat):
在重大危機發生時：
1. **Stop all scheduled posts** immediately using the **Batch Production Guide**. (停止所有排程貼文)
2. **One Voice**: You are the only person allowed to post official updates.
3. **Daily Update**: Post a 1-sentence progress report every 24 hours until the issue is resolved.
- **重點**：防止在危機期間發布不合時宜的「自動推廣」貼文。

## 🚀 Pro Tip | 專家建議
Build a "Support Fund" in your **Profit Reinvestment Strategy**. Having a $500 reserve allows you to hire a professional PR consultant or specialized legal advice for 1 hour during an actual emergency.
