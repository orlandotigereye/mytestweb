## 🔍 1. Where to Find the "Top 50" | 去哪裡找這 50 人？
Don't guess. Use these 3 data sources to find the most active riggers right now.
不要用猜的，使用這三個數據來源尋找目前最活躍的綁定師：

1. **Twitter/X Search**: Search for `#Live2DRigging` and sort by "Top." Look for creators with 2k - 10k followers. (搜尋標籤並按熱門排序)
2. **Booth.pm Top Sellers**: Go to the "Live2D" category on Booth. Look for the artists whose models are consistently in the "Top 10." (查看 Booth 上的暢銷創作者)
3. **Live2D Creative Awards**: Review the winners and finalists from the last 2 years. These are the technical leaders of the industry. (回顧年度大獎的獲獎者與決賽入圍者)

## 📊 2. Categorizing Your Map | 名單分類
Divide your targets into two groups:
將目標分為兩組：

- **Group A: The Rising Stars (2k - 5k followers)**
  - *Goal*: Partnership for **Joint Giveaways**. They are growing fast and want high-value gifts for their fans.
  - *目標*：聯名抽獎。他們成長迅速且需要好禮物回饋粉絲。
- **Group B: The Established Masters (10k+ followers)**
  - *Goal*: **Personalized Video Pitch**. You want them to use your tool for their professional portfolios to set the "Industry Standard."
  - *目標*：建立業界標準。讓大師級人物在作品集中使用您的工具。
