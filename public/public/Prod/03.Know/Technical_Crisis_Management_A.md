# Technical Crisis Management | 技術危機管理與停機處理指南

What to do when the tool breaks. Stay calm, communicate, and fix.
當工具失效時該怎麼辦。保持冷靜、溝通並修復。

## 🚨 1. Immediate Response Protocol | 立即應對協議
If you start receiving multiple bug reports:
如果您開始收到多個錯誤回報：

1. **Verify**: Run the **Technical Sanity Check** on your own machine. (立即自行驗證)
2. **Announce**: Post in your Discord `#📢-announcements` channel:
   - "We are aware of a technical issue with [Feature Name]. The team (me!) is investigating. Expect an update in X hours."
   - **重點**：主動告知，比讓使用者焦慮地等待更好。

## 📢 2. Customer Communication | 客戶溝通模板
**Subject**: Update regarding [Tool Name] technical issue 🛠️
**主旨**：關於 [工具名稱] 技術問題的更新通知 🛠️

"Hi everyone, 

A recent [Chrome/Google] update has temporarily affected the **Portfolio Master** recording script. 

**What's happening**: Some users are seeing [Describe Bug].
**The Fix**: I am currently updating the script to match the new standards. 
**Timeline**: I expect to have Version 1.2 ready by [Time/Date].

Thank you for your patience! I'll send an update as soon as the fix is live."

## 🛠️ 3. The "Rollback" Strategy | 回滾策略
Always keep the previous version of your scripts.
始終保留前一個版本的腳本。
- If Version 1.1 breaks, tell users to use Version 1.0 (the "Safe Version") while you work on the fix.
- **重點**：這就是為什麼我們在檔名加上 A, B, C 的重要性。

---

## 🛡️ 4. Handling Refunds | 處理退款
- **Policy**: If a Pro user’s project is delayed by more than 48 hours due to a bug you can't fix, offer a full refund or a free "Custom Setup" service as compensation.
- **Why**: A $29 refund is much cheaper than a negative review that costs you $1,000 in future sales.

## 🚀 Pro Tip | 專家建議
Schedule a **Weekly Technical Health Check** (10 minutes on Friday) to run your scripts and ensure everything is still working perfectly before the weekend.
