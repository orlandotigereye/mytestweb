當您達成第二里程碑且每日規律變成負擔時，即可考慮聘請。

Give them your documented guides! (直接將您已有的指南給他們看)

- **Daily Routine**: Using the **Daily Growth Routine_A.md**, have them handle the "Searching" and "Expert Engagement" parts. (執行每日規律)
- **Batch Editing**: Give them your raw MP4s and the **Video Editing Presets_A.md**. Have them edit the Reels in CapCut. (影片批量剪輯)
- **Outreach**: Have them send the initial **Complimentary Expert** scripts to riggers. (執行初步開發)

## 🛠️ 3. How to Manage | 如何管理
- **Tool**: Use **Trello** or **Notion** to track their tasks.
- **Communication**: Use **Slack** or a private Discord channel.
- **Verification**: They must log every action in your **Outreach Tracker**.

## 💰 4. Where to Find VAs | 去哪裡找人

## 🚀 Pro Tip | 專家建議
Start by delegating **ONE task** (e.g., "Finding 5 Reddit threads per day"). Once they prove they can do it perfectly using your guides, give them the next task. This is "Incremental Trust Building."
