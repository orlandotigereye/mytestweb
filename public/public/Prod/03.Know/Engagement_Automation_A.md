# Automated Social Media Engagement | 自動化社群互動策略

How to automate the "Outreach" phase using smart bots and filters.
如何利用智慧型機器人與過濾器自動化「開發引流」階段。

## 🤖 1. The Core Strategy: Attract, Don't Spam
Automation should be used to **Notify**, not to "Sell."
自動化應是用來「引起注意」，而非「強行銷售」。
- **Goal**: Get people to see your profile name so they click through to your **Bento.me** page.
- **目標**：讓潛在客戶頻繁看見您的名字，引發好奇心點擊。

## 🤖 2. Tool: PhantomBuster (The X/Twitter Engine)
- **Workflow**: 
  1. Monitor the hashtag `#Live2DRigging` every hour.
  2. "Like" every new post that gets at least 5 likes.
  3. Leave an automated comment on the most viral posts using a pre-written **Expert Hook**.
- **行動**：每小時監控標籤，點讚熱門貼文，並在爆文中留下「專家級」評論。

## 🤖 3. Smart Filter Logic | 智慧過濾邏輯
To avoid looking like a bot, your filters must be strict. (嚴格過濾以避免像廣告機器人)
- **Filter 1**: Do NOT comment on posts with zero engagement.
- **Filter 2**: Only comment on posts that mention "Recording," "Showcase," or "OBS."
- **Filter 3**: Use a list of 10 different variations of your **Complimentary Expert** script.

## 🤖 4. The "DM Auto-Reply" | 私訊自動回覆
On Instagram, use **ManyChat** or **Integromat**.
在 Instagram 使用 ManyChat。
- **Trigger**: User comments "LINK" on your Reel.
- **Action**: Automatically DM them the link to your **Lead Magnet**.
- **Benefit**: This increases your Reel's engagement while delivering the value instantly.
- **重點**：這能極大化 Reels 的演算法權重並即時交付價值。

## 🚀 Pro Tip | 專家建議
Always review the "Automated Comments" once a day for 5 minutes. If a bot leaves a weird comment, delete it immediately. You want to look like an **Expert**, not a script!
