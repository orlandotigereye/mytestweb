### **A. The Challenge (挑戰)**
Describe the customer's problem before they found you.

### **B. The Solution (解決方案)**
How they used the Portfolio Master to automate their specific model.
他們如何使用您的工具來自動化其特定模型。

### **C. The Result (結果)**
The quantifiable benefit (Time saved, Quality increase).
量化的好處（省下的時間、提升的畫質）。

## 🚀 Pro Tip | 專家建議
Focus on "Big Name" riggers for your first few case studies. Offering a free custom setup to a well-known artist in exchange for a detailed case study is one of the best investments you can make.
