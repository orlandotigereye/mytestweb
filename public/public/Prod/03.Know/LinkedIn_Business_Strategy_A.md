## 🎯 1. The Professional Pivot | 專業轉型定位
On LinkedIn, don't talk about "Live2D." Talk about **"Content Production Efficiency."**
在 LinkedIn 上，不要只談 "Live2D"，要談「內容製作效率」。
- **English**: "Reducing VTuber content production costs via workflow automation."
- **Chinese**: 「透過工作流自動化降低 VTuber 內容製作成本。」

## 🎯 2. Target Audience | 目標對象
Connect with people holding these titles:
與擁有這些職稱的人建立聯繫：
- **Talent Manager** (at VTuber Agencies like Hololive, Nijisanji, or smaller indies).
- **Creative Director** (at marketing agencies using virtual avatars).
- **Founder/CEO** (of VTuber-tech startups).

## 📝 3. Content Strategy | 內容策略
Share "Data-Driven" posts.
分享「數據驅動」的貼文。
- **Post A**: "How we reduced showcase recording time by 85% using headless browser automation." (分享自動化節省時間的數據)

## 💬 4. The Corporate Pitch | 企業端提案腳本
"Hi [Name], I noticed [Agency Name] is producing incredible content with your talents. I specialize in VTuber workflow automation—specifically reducing the manual labor involved in recording high-quality character showcases. I've developed a system that cuts recording time significantly. Would love to share a 5-minute case study if you're looking to optimize your internal production."

## 💰 5. High-Ticket Services | 高單價服務內容

Share your **Executive Summary** as a PDF document on LinkedIn. It looks much more professional than a simple text post and acts as a "Business Whitepaper."
