## 📊 1. Affiliate Tracking | 銷售追蹤
- **Primary Tool**: **Gumroad Affiliates**.
- **Setup**: 
  1. Add the partner's Email to your Gumroad Affiliate dashboard.
  2. Set the commission rate to **40%**.
  3. Send them their unique link (e.g., `gumroad.com/l/product/affiliate_id`).
- **Why**: Gumroad handles the tracking and tax compliance automatically.

## 💰 2. Payment Schedule | 支付時程
Transparency builds trust. Tell your partners exactly when they get paid.
透明度建立信任。明確告知夥伴撥款時間。
- **Rule**: Payouts are handled by Gumroad every Friday (for sales from the previous week).
- **Minimum**: No minimum payout (Gumroad standard).

## 📞 3. Partner Relationship Management (PRM) | 夥伴關係維護
- **Monthly Check-in**: On the 1st of every month, DM your active partners: "Hey [Name], thanks for the support last month! Anything I can do to help with your next showcase?"
- **Early Access**: Always give your partners the new version of your tool **7 days before** the public launch.
- **重點**：讓夥伴感覺自己是「核心團隊」的一份子。

## 📝 4. Dispute Resolution | 爭議處理
- If a user claims they used a partner's link but the sale didn't track: **Manually add the commission** to the partner's next month's payment. 
- **Reason**: Maintaining the partner's trust is worth more than the $10 commission.

## 🚀 Pro Tip | 專家建議
Create a private "Partner-Only" channel in your Discord. This allows your influencers to talk to each other and share tips on how to best promote your tool.
