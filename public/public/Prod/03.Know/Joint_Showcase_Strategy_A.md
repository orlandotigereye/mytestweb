# Influencer Collaboration: The Joint Showcase | 聯合展示合作策略

How to explode your reach by combining two audiences in one video.
如何透過在一段影片中結合兩組受眾，來讓您的觸及率爆發。

## 🤝 1. The Concept | 核心概念
A "Joint Showcase" uses the **Duo Recording Script (Pro I)** to record two popular VTubers interacting using your tool. 
「聯合展示」利用**雙人錄製腳本 (Pro I)**，錄製兩位熱門 VTuber 使用您的工具進行互動的畫面。

## 🤝 2. The Pitch to VTubers | 邀約提案
"Hey [Name A] and [Name B]! I’m a huge fan of your dynamic. I built a Live2D automation tool that allows two characters to act out a script together perfectly. I’d love to help you record a 30-second 'Mini-Drama' for your socials using my tool. It’s 100% automated and results in professional animation quality. Interested in a collab?"

## 🎥 3. The Content Formula | 內容公式
- **The Dialogue**: Use a "Trending Sound" or a funny skit from a popular anime. (使用熱門音訊或動漫迷因)
- **The Visual**: Side-by-side performance where characters look at each other and react. (角色互相對視與反應的並排表演)
- **The Tag**: Both VTubers post the video and tag you as the "Automation Director."

---

## 🚀 4. Why this works | 為什麼這有效
- **Cross-Promotion**: You reach Audience A AND Audience B.
- **Validation**: If two popular VTubers use your tool, it instantly becomes the "Gold Standard" in the community.
- **Zero Ads**: This is purely organic, high-engagement entertainment.

---

## 💡 Pro Tip | 專家建議
Offer to write the script and handle the technical recording for them. Make it **ZERO WORK** for the VTubers, and they will almost always say "Yes."
